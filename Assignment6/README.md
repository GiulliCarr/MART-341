<p>So I decided to combine two of my ideas: the design blog and the live music tracker. My idea is that it'll be a blog-style newsletter that announces local artists that are a must to check out. I still want to incporporate the design aspect, so will also have elements of design trends, along with niche music trends.I want it to eventually have a really cool, artistic hip aesthetic, with a lot of interactive icons to click through.</p>

<p>Trying to utlize the design concepts we've covered was fun. I actually really want to make this blog/newsletter a reality now, and even created a logo and ideas on what I want to cover! My design turned out in a way how I expected it to look for now. I'm sure as we continue through this semester I'll be able to really format the exact design layout I want for this project, and be able to incporporate the moving pieces/clickable icons. It's crazy but this assignment somehow brought me out of this weird creative funk I've kind of been in for awhile.</p>
