<h1>My Incredible Thought Process For Each Idea</h1>

<h2>Design Blog</h2>
<p>I follow a lot of design blogs already (think Creative Good, Rolling Stone etc.), and I would love to one day dip my feet into that world. I like to think I have a good eye for new and cool art/design, so what better way to broadcast that than a blog?</p>

<h2>Food Blog</h2>
<p>Honestly, I just thought it would be funny to have a website where people give dramatic reviews of mediocre places to eat. Personally, I get a kick out of stuff like that, and I just know there is a whole community of people out there who would get me.</p>

<h2>Music Website</h2>
<p>I am a big fan of music, music culture, concerts etc. I live and breathe music. AKA, according to Airbuds I listen to an average of 2,400 minutes of music a week...<br>So with this website idea, I would honestly just love to have better access to local music shows in my area, so that I'm supporting local artists and businesses, and not feeding so much into the corporate money grab that is Ticketmaster and Live Nation.</p>
