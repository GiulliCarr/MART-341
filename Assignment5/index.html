<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h2>Design Blog</h2>
<p>I feel like this one is self explanatory..<br>Kidding so with this one, picture a lifestyle blog but for all things design. Whether it be interior, graphic, editorial, it's a blog meant to broadcats up and coming trends, timeless classics, and spotlight creators that are goign to revolutionize the art world. The layout would be similar to that of a Substack blog, but obviously as a stand alone website. I'd want to incorporate a lot of mixed media elements that are interactive, so think animated photographs, videos that play when the cursor hovers over it, easter eggs when you press the arrow keys a certain way etc. Clearly I've given this thought before.</p>

<h2>Reverse Food Blog</h2>
<p>So with this it's kinda satire, so don't take the idea too seriously. Basically it's a food blog where the public community can contribute, and it's essentially a neverending list of restaurants to avoid at all costs, but for the most ridiculous reasons. Didn't like the ambient lighting? Put it on the list. Thought the fries were too soggy? On the list it goes. There's no discrimination on how ritzy, dingy, or weird a restaurant is, so long as you have a grievance to share.</p>

<h2>Music Search</h2>
<p>This idea is for a website where you can put your location anywhere in the world, and using an algorithm, will give you a detailed list and map visuals of live music events around your area. You'll have the option to specifically find certain genres of music, price points, and local shows. It's a website meant to bring community within the music space, and highlight local and independent artists to get more exposure.</p>
