:D this was FUN
Ok so here are the techniques I used:
1. Dropdown: Added a dropdown menu under "Music" in the navigation bar with options for all of the music specific pages, making the menu show up when you hover over it
2. Position: Used position: fixed to keep the header and navigation bar stuck to the top of the page. Also used this for the dropdown menu right under the "Music" link so it looks neat.
3. Sizing:Set the images in the "Events" section to 100px by 100px so they all match, and adjusted the inline blocks so they’re balanced and don’t take up too much space.
4. Padding:Added some padding around the paragraph box to make it line up with the header and look clean, and gave the boxes and sections a little breathing room so the content doesn’t feel squished.
5. Display: Used display: flex to place the "Artists to Watch" and "Events" blocks side by side. I made the dropdown menu hidden by default, showing up when hovered over.
6. Border: Put a border around the navigation bar to make it stand out more. I also rounded the corners of the boxes a bit with border-radius to make them look smoother (there's something about the sharp edges that make it seem so sterile)
