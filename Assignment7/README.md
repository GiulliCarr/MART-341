<p>I'd say I'm most proud of the hierarchy I implemented on the events page. I feel like it flows well, even if it's just simple CSS styling. I'm happy with how the form looks contrasted with the colors, I think it was a smart move. It makes me want to go back to the original main page and implement the same colors, as I feel it's more fitting of the overall vibe I'm trying to put out there.</p>
