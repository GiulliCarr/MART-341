At Least 4 Pages – I decided to make this a first attempt at making a portfolio website for myself (hopefully in the future I can build on this and make it look insanely cool and interactive).

Responsive Design and Media Queries – For screens smaller than 768px: the grid adjusts to two columns. For screens smaller than 480px: the grid becomes a single column, with smaller header and text sizes.

Navigation Menu – The navigation menu is designed to be underneath the header of each page to keep it highly visible.

Dropdown Menu – I added a drop-down menu for my art, specifically for school projects and professional work.
