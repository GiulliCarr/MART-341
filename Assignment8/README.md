Div (at least 2)
I used the Div function to break apart the big meaty pieces of the webpage. So the header/navigation, video, album list, and audio footer are all using divs
Span (at least 2)
Span is used primarily within the album list, to create even spacing throughout. It also helped with organizing the type with the album cover, and I'm really happy with how that part turned out
Audio (at least 1)
Audio I just sourced a generic jazz tune from Pixabay
Video (at least 1)
For the video originally I wanted it to play a playlist I made on Youtube of my favorite songs from each album, but I was having difficulty getting that embedded. Instead I chose the music video for Fever by Balthazar, although Grapefruit may be the best song on the album...
Iframe (at least 1)
I utilized Iframe for the youtube video. I kept it small so that it was not overpowering the list. Looking at it, I find it looks slightly wonky, but keeping it at the bottom of the page doesn't work either. 
Class (at least 2)
I used class for each div, just to keep things organized, and it works for me.
Escape character (at least 1)
I utilized the escape character function in the footer of the webpage, underneath the audio file.
