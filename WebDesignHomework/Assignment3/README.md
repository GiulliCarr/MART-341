# Assignment 3

## Woah look a subheading

This module was honestly a little tricky for me to grasp. I have used Visual Studio Code prior to this class, but not to the extent in which we learned this week. It was **HARD** lol. That being said, here is a fun lil *list* highlighting the things I did.

### Visual Studio Code and How I Tried My Best At It

- **Creating a new project**: I quite literally could not for the life of me remember how to create a new project
- **File Management**: If there's one thing I'm going to excel in, it's managing my files. Doing it in Visual Studio proved to be a but more challenging
- **Screenshots**: I've tried adding images to my html code within VSC in the past to no avail.

I had to put a link, so this is [Baggu](https://www.baggu.com/).
