Oooof, making this with CCS and trying to copy the same design as the album rotation page was a bit tricky, since I didn't use CSS on the other one. I was able to make it work the best I could though!
I wanted to stick with the same aesthetic as the other page that I was most proud of, so I essentially used the same formatting. What differed was grouping certain things togther (like the paragraphs and images), and seeing how that would translate as descriptions in CSS. It's not perfect, but it gives me a good start for a more cohesive look for the overall website I'm making!
Although I do find that I enjoy designing each individual page best, as (at least with my website) each page is a little bit different in content, so a generic layout might not work for it.
